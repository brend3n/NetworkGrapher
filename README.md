# NetworkGrapher


### To-Do
- [ ] Nodes are colored based on neighborhoods
- [ ] If one nodes is in two or more different groups, blend the colors together for that node
- [ ] Keep track of information about the network
- [ ] Unlimited scrolling 
- [ ] Dyanmic loading such that large amounts of data can be visualized incrementally
- [ ] Group nodes in the same neighborhood close to eachother -> adjust randomness of node location
