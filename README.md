# NetworkGrapher

NetworkGrapher is a network or graph visualizer created with the p5 Javascript library. The aim of this is to easily visualize networks on a web application. After having trouble with importing data into network visualization software like Cytoscape, NetworkGrapher was created to easily load in a network from a text file.



### To-Do
- [ ] Nodes are colored based on neighborhoods
- [ ] If one nodes is in two or more different groups, blend the colors together for that node
- [ ] Keep track of information about the network
- [ ] Unlimited scrolling 
- [ ] Dyanmic loading such that large amounts of data can be visualized incrementally
- [ ] Group nodes in the same neighborhood close to eachother -> adjust randomness of node location
